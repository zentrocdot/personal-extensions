# Personal AUTOMATIC1111 Extension

## Preface

After working with the web UI Easy Diffusion, I switched to the web UI AUTOMATIC1111. It remains to be seen whether I will remain loyal to it in the long term. Unfortunately, one have to assume that the days of AUTOMATIC1111 are numbered, as there is no adaptation to the current versions of Gradio, for example. Various Python modules are already in conflict with each other if you keep the systems in use up to date. More problematic are the bugs of the Gradio version, which is in use AUTOMATIC1111.These make programming the simplest extensions very laborious.

## Extension I Wrote So Far

* sd-webui-predefined_aspect_ratios

  + Extensions which is adding predefined aspect ratio buttons to the web UI

* sd-webui-aspect_ratios-dd

  + Extensions which is adding predefined aspect ratio selectable via a dropdown menu to the web UI   

* sd-webui-aspect_ratio2width_height

  + Calculates Width and Hight to a given aspect ratio 
  
* sd-webui-aspect_ratio_calc

  + Calculates Width and Hight for a given aspect ratio 

* sd-webui-calc_aspect_ratio

  + Calculates the aspect ratio from Width and Hight of the web UI  

* sd-webui-lora_metadata_viewer

  + Adds a tab in which the LoRA metadata can be displayed.  

## Usage

It is not desired and not allowed to add the extensions that I have painstakingly written to the AUTOMATIC1111 Extension Repository.
