# Personal AUTOMATIC1111 Extension

## Preface

<p align="justify">After working with the web UI <i>Easy Diffusion</i>, I switched to the web UI <i>AUTOMATIC1111</i>. It remains to be seen whether I will remain loyal to it in the long term. Unfortunately, one have to assume that the days of <i>AUTOMATIC1111</i> are numbered, as there is no adaptation to the current versions of <i>Gradio</i>, for example. Various <i>Python</i> modules are already in conflict with each other if you keep the systems in use up to date. More problematic are the bugs of the <i>Gradio</i> version, which is in use by <i>AUTOMATIC1111</i>. These make programming the simplest <i>Extension</i> next to other reasons very laborious.</p>

<p align="justify">In the 10 days that I have been working on programming in AUTOMATIC1111, you can't expect miracles. The extensions got better with the learning effect I had. Since my extensions for the <i>AUTOMATIC1111</i> are not of high enough quality, to put it diplomatically, I will leave it at availability via this page. I leave it to the user to judge their usefulness.</p>

<p align="justify">The extensions fulfil their purpose and do what they are supposed to and are a great help to me. </p>

## Extension I Wrote So Far

### Current Extensions

The following list are the <i>Extensions</i>, which I am using in my daily work:

* sd-webui-aspect_ratios-dd

  + Extensions which is adding predefined aspect ratio selectable via a dropdown menu to the web UI   

* sd-webui-aspect_ratio2width_height

  + Calculates Width and Hight from a given aspect ratio and allows taking them over to the web UI
  
* sd-webui-aspect_ratio_calc

  + Calculates the aspect ratio from given Width and Hight or from the given values by the web UI

* sd-webui-lora_metadata_viewer

  + Adds a tab in which the LoRA metadata can be displayed, downloaded and copied.
 
* sd-webui-adjust_lora_filename

  + Adds a tab in which the LoRA tag for the outputfile can be checked and updated 
 
### Deprecated Extensions

<p align="justify">I have learnt some basic things from the following outdated extensions. These experiences have been incorporated into the extensions mentioned above. The extensions are sexist and work. I will no longer maintain them.</p>

* sd-webui-predefined_aspect_ratios

  + Extensions which is adding predefined aspect ratio buttons to the web UI

* sd-webui-calc_aspect_ratio

  + Calculates the aspect ratio from Width and Hight of the web UI
 
## Installation

The installation of each Extension is as easy as it is. Go to tab Extensions and go to tab Install from URL. Put in the link from the reference and your are done.

## Usage

<p align="justify">It is not desired and not allowed to add the extensions that I have painstakingly written the last week over to the AUTOMATIC1111 Extension Repository.</p>
